	*1:
Binary sum, so each next answer increases the answers sum by power of 2: 1, 2, 4, 8...
If there is only one (or 0) correct answer, then the "answers sum" will be the power of 2.
If there are 5 options and only the 1st and the 3rd answers are correct, then the sum will be 1*1 + 2*0 + 4*1 + 8*0 + 16*0 = 5.
If all answers are corrects then the sum will be equals to options^2 - 1, for 10 questions - 1023.



	*2:
1: 				text
2: 				image
3 (1+2): 		text + image
4: 				audio
8: 				video
15 (1+2+4+8):	text + image + audio + video
And so on...
